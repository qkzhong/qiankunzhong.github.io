abstract: Understanding online communities requires an appreciation of both
  structure and culture. But basic questions remain difficult to pose. How do
  these facets interact and drive each other? Using data on the membership and
  governance styles of 5,000 small-scale online communities, we construct
  empirical measures for cross-server similarities in institutional structure
  and culture to explore the influence of institutional environment on their
  culture, and the influence of culture on their institutional environment. To
  establish the influence of culture and institutions on each other, we
  construct networks of communities, linking those that are more similar either
  in their members or governance. We then use network analysis to assess the
  causal relationships between shared culture and institutions. Our result shows
  that while effects in both directions are evident, there is a much stronger
  role for institutions on culture than culture on institutions. These processes
  are evident within administrative and informational type rules.
