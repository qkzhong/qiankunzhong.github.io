abstract: Theorists since Marx, Bourdieu, and DiMaggio have asked how individual
  choices on cultural preference interact with collective social network
  structure. The rise of social media in todayâ€™s communication landscape
  motivates us to take a closer look at the involved dynamics. We designed an
  agent-based model to explore how different behavioral principles for cultural
  choice and communicative affiliation affect (1) collective consumption
  patterns, (2) social segregation, and (3) resilience of the emergent dynamic
  during exogenous distributions. We analyze the influence of individual agency
  on network structure, and vice versa, by simulating agents who pursue elite or
  popular culture, while communicating with others based on homophily or
  randomness. Our method allows us to go beyond specific constellations and
  explore the realm of theoretically possible combinations. We then used an
  exogenous disturbance on elite culture cost to test the resilience of social
  network structure. We found that only in societies where economic factors
  drive cultural consumption, increased access to elite culture can lead to
  reorganization in the social network and reduce segregation between different
  social groups. This is because the disturbance on consumption provides agents
  opportunities to connect with other social groups and opens a window for
  social mixing. We end by discussing how our model allows us to inform a
  diverse set of empirical research questions, including the cultural markets of
  social media, the digital divide, and the split between free misinformation
  and established news outlets.
