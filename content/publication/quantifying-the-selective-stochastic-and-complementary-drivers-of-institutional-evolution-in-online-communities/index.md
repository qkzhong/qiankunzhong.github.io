abstract: "Institutions and cultures usually evolve in response to environmental
  incentives. However, sometimes institutional change occurs due to stochastic
  drivers beyond current fitness, including drift, path dependency, blind
  imitation, and complementary cooperation in fluctuating environments.
  Disentangling the selective and stochastic components of social system change
  enables us to identify the key features of long-term organizational
  development. Evolutionary approaches provide organizational science with
  abundant theories to demonstrate organizational evolution by tracking
  beneficial or harmful features. In this study, focusing on 20,000 Minecraft
  communities, we measure these drivers empirically using two of the most widely
  applied evolutionary models: the Price equation and the bet-hedging model. As
  a result, we find strong selection pressure on administrative and information
  rules, suggesting that their positive correlation with community fitness is
  the main reason for their frequency change. We also find that stochastic
  drivers decrease the average frequency of administrative rules. The result
  makes sense when viewed in the context of evolutionary bet-hedging. We show
  through the bet-hedging result that institutional diversity contributes to the
  growth and stability of rules related to information, communication, and
  economic behaviors"
