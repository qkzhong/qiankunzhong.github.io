When we’re talking about someone being naïve, it usually means that the person does not know the implicit social norms that actually drives social interactions. Instead, they rely on the explicit rules. But why do some people stay naïve through their lifetime? Because they succeed without the implicit social norms either because their social positions is stable, or because they’re lucky, or because they are the genius in this generation, or they used one strategy and they succeed. The fact is that most people only know part of the implicit norms and then they stop at the position when they succeed. People who have the more complete repertoire of norms and strategies are the people who fail more. And those people are the most efficient to transmit those knowledge to the next generation and they are also more likely to reinforce those norms.

Imagine a model where people succeed at random rate. Successful people will stop acquiring new strategies when they succeed but people who fail will keep learning new things from successful people. Once people get one success, they will gain new success easier. In what kind of society are people more “naïve” and in what kind of society are they more skillful in social strategies? And which is more effective in growth and transmitting knowledge?
