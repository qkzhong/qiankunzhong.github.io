summary: Self-censorship is the practice of people withholding opinions or
  information from their audience, self-censorship. Self-censorship can be
  beneficial, from an individual’s perspective, when personal safety is at risk
  in politically charged environments. Yet, when overall expression is limited,
  self-censorship reduces the timely flow of critical information and the scope
  for civic engagement, undermining the democratic process. In this project, I
  study the social network underpinnings of self-censorship and propose ways in
  which social media platforms can limit its extent.

In Communication, often times we try to understand social phenomenon through what people talk about. However, a lot of information is hidden in what they choose not to talk about. This hidden information may help us understand the social dynamics better, especially in changing environments. 

My dissertation research thus focus on this practice of people withholding opinions or information from their audience, self-censorship. Self-censorship can be beneficial, from an individual’s perspective, when personal safety is at risk in politically charged environments. Yet, when overall expression is limited, self-censorship reduces the timely flow of critical information and the scope for civic engagement, undermining the democratic process. In this project, I study the social network underpinnings of self-censorship and propose ways in which social media platforms can limit its extent.     

One of the main reasons for self-censorship is people's uncertainty about the potential sensitivity of their statements or actions. On social media, when users can't access sensitive information, platform administrators can increase the users' uncertainty about a given topic's political sensitivity, leading to even higher degrees of self-censorship. How can users come across such withheld information and ultimately reduce their uncertainty, as well as their self-censorship?

Existing studies in information science only provide contradicting answers. On one hand, communication studies have put forth that, under particular network structures, wisdom arises from crowds, with large groups making better judgments than small elites. On the other hand, several agent-based and empirical evidence point to the inherent ambiguity of connections for truth searching: better connected groups can indeed reach an agreement faster, regardless of the veracity of their agreement's content.

As a result, I plan to build on these earlier insights and provide a comprehensive answer to the question: 

*What kind of network structure and principles of interaction discourage the individual drive to self-censor?*Nullam vel molestie justo. Curabitur vitae efficitur leo.
