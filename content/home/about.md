I'm a postdoc researcher at Center for Humans and Machines, Max Planck Institute for Human Development. I study cultural change and machine behaviors through the lens of cultural evolution and tools in computational social science.

Currently, I have three lines of research.(1) Group-level selection of AI behaviors. (2) Censorship [self-censorship](https://chungqk5.wixsite.com/qiankunzhong/projects) through modeling and empirical analysis; (3) Quantifying the evolution and dynamics of [institutions and culture](https://chungqk5.wixsite.com/qiankunzhong/projects) among online community collaborations.
