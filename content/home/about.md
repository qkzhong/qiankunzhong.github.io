I'm a PhD student in the Department of Communication at UC Davis, with Designated Emphasis in Computational Social Science. I study when and why individuals communicate, conceal, and collectively decide on which matters through the lens of cultural evolution and tools in computational social science.

Currently, I have three lines of research. (1) Investing when and how would people reduce [self-censorship](https://chungqk5.wixsite.com/qiankunzhong/projects) through modeling and empirical analysis; (2) Quantifying the evolution and dynamics of [institutions and culture](https://chungqk5.wixsite.com/qiankunzhong/projects) among online community collaborations; (3) Modeling and analyzing individual [cognitions and behaviors](https://chungqk5.wixsite.com/qiankunzhong/projects) on social media and VR.
